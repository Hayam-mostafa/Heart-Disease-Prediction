Support Vector Machine | 0.5333 | 0.2844    | 0.5333  | 0.3710   | 0.7659

âœ… Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression

Insights
--------
- Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy and ROC AUC.
- Random Forest and SVM showed decent recall but lower precision.
- Decision Tree had the lowest overall performance.
- ROC AUC suggests Logistic Regression is most capable of distinguishing between classes.

Recommendations
---------------
- Consider using Logistic Regression as baseline.
- Try ensemble techniques like Voting Classifier.
- Explore class balancing techniques if data is imbalanced.
- Further tuning or feature engineering may improve the Random Forest and SVM results.
